            <p class="kalam">My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently,
                courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path,
                courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed.
                These are great qualities that they must work towards.
                This is my message to the young people.</p>

            <p class="swindoll">We cannot change our past.
                We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way.
                We can not change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is
                play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude.</p>

            <p class="swami">Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life
                - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea.
                Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea,
                and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.</p>
