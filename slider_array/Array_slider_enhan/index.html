                    <p>After graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor’s Degree
                        (First Class Honours) in Multimedia Programming and Design,
                        I spent the last nine years working both as a freelance web developer
                        and designer and as part of a team in various companies across Galway,
                        Dublin, Berlin and Melbourne. I acquired project and time management skills,
                        as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while
                        effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.</p>

                    <p>Since turning my passion into a career, I’ve worked as a professional photographer

                        and on the cover of Tasmania 40° South Magazine. My fine art prints appear in
                        the University of Melbourne’s collection.</p>
